I have always tried to lose weight but I kept on failing.I was never ashamed of the way I looked but I always tried to lower my weight to have a healthy lifestyle.

To sum it up I always gained more weight rather than losing it.One day however,my sister randomly showed me the Lose To Gain 12week program.Later I spoke to Sajedur bhaia and speaking to him motivated me even more.He told me that I should not even start this program if wasn't for my own sake.Usually our family members are the ones who encourage us to lose weight but after some time we give up and go back to an unhealthy life style.So I told him that I want to do this for myself and than started the program.It was a little tough at first not being able to eat all my favorite food but eventually I got used to it.Best part about this program was,Sajedur bhaia would always keep himself updated with my progress and would guide me further to achieve my goal.He even modified my diet if I didn't feel like having something repeatedly.

Finally after 3months I lost 4.2kgs more than what I wanted to lose at first.This truly has been an amazing experience and I would like to thank Lose to Gain and Sajedur bhaia for my accomplishment.I highly recommend this program to anybody who wants to lose weight in the most natural and easy going way.(I still have a long way to go but In Sha Allah I will be able to get the body I always wanted)
