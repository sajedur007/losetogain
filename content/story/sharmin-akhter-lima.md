Alhamdulillah at first all praise goes to Allah for giving me the strength to strictly follow the diet plan given by Sajedur vai. This is really really tough to follow at the very beginning of the journey but later on I totally accustomed with the plan.

I never believe that I can be able to reduce 10kg weight. Finally the dreams came true and now I feel more confident that if I want I can reduce more 5kg as well.

The most toughest challenge for me was to perform regular exercise. I never thought that I would be able to do it. But when I start all comes under my control alhamdulillah within few days.

The diet chart, regular exercise, control the temptations all are just a matter of my will. Whatever I wanted 2 years back, now it's reality only because of the great mentor Sajedur bhaia.

He is a very humble person.When I was sick Sajedur bhai took follow-up regularly about my health condition and give me instructions in such way that I feel motivated to move forward.

The journey was not so easy but wasn't that much tough as well, only your will power is enough to reduce the weight that you wish for.

I will recommend strongly Sajedur Rahman bhaia as a mentor to anyone who want to see him/herself in a better shape with a healthy lifestyle accustomed with.
