I never thought I will ever lose this pregnancy weight in my life but I did! All thanks to Sajedur Rahman bhaia and his group Lose to Gain. I did the mentorship program with him twice and lost about 15kgs in total . What I have done has only been possible for my mentor Sajedur bhai. I can never thank him enough for being this sincere, understanding and helpful. I have already suggested this group to many of my friends and family and I will always suggest this group to anyone who needs to get back into shape. This group and a mentor like Sajedur bhai will support you,guide you and most importantly understand you to make your journey of losing weight doable and realistic.
