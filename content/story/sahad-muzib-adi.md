Current weight-91.0 kg

Weight loss- 15.7 kg

Height- 5”7

At first all praise to Allah subhanwatala for this weight loss.And secondly really greatful to this group specifically my mentor Sajedur rahman vhai.

It’s been a great journey.i have always been overweight.During lockdown i tried Keto diet and managed to loose some weight but i gained again.

my wife Sanjida Mishi introduced me to this wonderful group..the program was designed according to my needs. # sajedur rahman vhai is a great mentor. full of positivity and good vibes. he never forced anything on.

In sha Allah will be able to loose some more weight by following the steps.

Will update again if i can loose more in future

Till then lots of love

\# lose to gain

\# sajedur rahman

special thanks to my wife for helping me through the journey and always supporting me..
