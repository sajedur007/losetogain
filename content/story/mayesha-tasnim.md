Between 73-61 kg, I lost weight normally without doing anything since it was pregnancy weight. From 73-66/65 I lost weight without doing nothing. From 65 to 61 I tried to control on my own. The picture that I am attaching is when I was 63kg.

Before I conceived I was : 57kg (in 2017)

Now i am : 49kg!!!![游땏](file:////Users/sajed/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.png =12x12)![游땎](file:////Users/sajed/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image002.png =12x12)![游땏](file:////Users/sajed/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.png =12x12)![游](file:////Users/sajed/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image003.png =12x12)![游때](file:////Users/sajed/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image004.png =12x12)![游때](file:////Users/sajed/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image004.png =12x12)![游때](file:////Users/sajed/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image004.png =12x12)![游때](file:////Users/sajed/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image004.png =12x12)

1\. I followed my chart strictly. It was a 3 months program. I did not cheat even for a single meal!!! I bought the kitchen scale from rfl and I measured the food on that accurately. 150gm means 150gm! Sometimes it was 148gm but never 152gm! Also i had 4/5 charts during this diet regime. All modified based on my weight lose routine and my body measurement

2\. I did not do any exercise or walking in first 2 months.

3\. I started to walk for one hour from the beginning of third month. And for last 2 weeks I have been doing some light workout. I will give you the link.

4\. Yesterday was the last date of my diet,that means I will eat in a moderate way but will continue with the walking and exercise. If your body permits only then do the exercise otherwise skip it.

5\. Remember diet means not to remain hungry. It means to have a balanced food habit.

6\. All throughout these three months I ate carb,fat,protein all. My chart had rice,butter,bread,muri,cornflakes,milk,chicken,fish,veg etc.

7\. The best part was my mentor Sajed. He used to change my food if i got bored immediately. He is amazing!!! He was strict when he needed to be, he motivated me when it was needed.
