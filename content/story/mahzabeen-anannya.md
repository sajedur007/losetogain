So, I wanted to adopt a healthy lifestyle and I have adopted and failed to maintain them adopted again and failed yet again...

But this time I wanted to be bit more under monitoring and try to have someone to report back to...

My goal was, to be very honest, to get myself used to healthy fooding pattern and then the result in turn weight-lose and more-energy..

Sajedur bhaia was patient and what I liked most is that I never ever feel that I am under someoneâ€™s watch yet I knew I have someone who can help me. He gave me diet charts...excercise schedules and Allah knows I have failed multiple times to cope up...but when I wanted to have biriyani...when I wanted to drink coffee with milk...when I wanted to have anything I asked and then I got the right advice...

Then there are cases where I have few times modified myself using my knowledge depending on the necessity...this is also my learning from him, the group and from fit guide...

I have lost weights quite a few times in my life and I know how to lose weight...but what I wanted to learn this time was how to get myself into something that will keep me health and happy...

This is my healthy transformation journey...

18 weeks later

I have lost 9 kgs...

I have lost 3 inches respectively from chest and hip...and 4.5 inches from waist...

And what I gained is enormous energy...loving the food and cherishing it...and knowing how to be content
