My whole life has been like a see-saw!

I was always a chubby kid but I was very health conscious during my University days. I used to weigh 50 kg when I finished my Uni life.Then my job life started , 4 years have passed ,got married and became 75 My blood pressure and cholesterol level went so high, weight না কমালে কি হত কে জানে!

Then i got to know about Sajedur Rahman bhai from Mayesha Tasnim apu and was under his observation. যদিও ভাইরে একটু গুতান লাগে WhatsApp e but the Best parts of his diet charts were YOU WON'T BE STARVING AND FOODS WERE YUMMMM!!!

I took the 3 months paid service ,sajed bhai was my mentor and got my desired weight within the time window 

I started with 74 around I ended up being 64 kgs.

Though My goal weight is 55-57 according to my height 5 .2" but Alhamdulillah I look way thinner than 64

NB: last রোজার ঈদে চিট না করলে sure আরো 5 kg কমতাম
