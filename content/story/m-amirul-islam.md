It was a great journey with my mentor Sajed Bhai for 12 weeks from 25 January 2022 to 18 April 2022. When I started this program, I wasn’t quite sure whether I could continue this program for 12 weeks! Because, I am a food lover and it is really hard for me to control myself if the subject is food! But with the great plan & guidance provided by Sajed Bhai I was able to complete this 12-week program (I would say successfully!)! Special thanks to my wife @ Rita Islam for preparing & measuring the meals everyday & motivating me to follow the diet plan (& encouraged/prohibited me from fast food/café while I was at work), this made it much easier to follow this plan!

I really can’t thank Sajed bhai enough for his excellent guidance and mentorship. As personally, I am very busy with my full-time job and another consultancy business. It is not so easy for me to manage time for exercise and keep myself active throughout the day. But Sajed Bhai guided throughout the program and advised how to get time for myself for a healthy lifestyle & well-being.

Now the challenge is to keep my weight at a desired level. Sajed Bhai gave me a guideline on how can I keep my weight at a desired level. I know that in any case Sajed bhai, Team Loose 2 Gain and the awesome members of Team Loose 2 Gain are here to help!
