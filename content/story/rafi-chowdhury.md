12 Weeks Premium Mentorship Review:

Mentor: Sajedur Rahman

Previous Weight: 88.2 KG

Current Weight: 77.6

Lost: 10.6 KG

Height: 5'9"

Since 2015, I was always over 85 KG (attached is a weight graph). I think I was insulin resistant; that's why it was tough for me to lose weight and keep the lost weight. Previously I tried to lose weight with exercise (with an elliptical trainer) alone but only managed to get to 82 KG. But within a few weeks, I gained all the lost weights and more. Three months ago, I reached my max weight of 88.2 KG. My wife and I decided to do the couples weight loss program with Sajedur Rahman.

After an extensive discussion and lifestyle questionnaire, he provided me a low-carb diet plan (with a very easy-to-follow diet chart). Plus, an exercise plan (with video). Almost every day, I walked/jog for 45 minutes + did some light-weight training. Initially, I lost 2 KG then gained 2 KG (Because of Eid Dawat) while in this program. The first few weeks were a bit tricky, but later I stopped craving junk food.

Key Findings:

There is always a lot of anti-diet peer pressure in our culture, and I could've never followed it if I was doing it alone. Find a buddy who can keep you motivated.

We do not have to eat a plate full of rice.

Stop snacking.

As everyone has a different body type, consult with a professional.
