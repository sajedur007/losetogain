12 weeks program with Sajedur Rahman vai

Before weight - 98 kg

After weight - 85

Lost - 13 kg

I was about 104 kg in August 2020. I lost about 6 kgs by following diet for 4 weeks. After that I was not loosing anymore. Then I consulted with Sajed Vai and started 12 weeks paid program in October 2020. I lost 13 kgs more in this journey. I had some personal issues in couple of weeks; otherwise I would hit 15 kgs mark. Thanks to Sajed Vai for continuous support and help. I learned a lot of things through this group and sajed Vai. Thanks to all. I know I am still overweight and will continue to loose some more.
