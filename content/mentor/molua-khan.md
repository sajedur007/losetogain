Before starting formal practice as a mentor, I transformed myself by proper diet and exercise. I enjoy living out my passion for health and fitness. Fitness is my passion. I love to stay fit and healthy myself. Along with that, I love inspiring others to see their potential and motivating them to achieve their goals. I believe in making health a lifestyle choice, not just a temporary solution and I believe in keeping fitness fun and motivating. I have a vision through Lose to Gain to make people educated in nutrition and fitness in our country. So, let me help you look better, feel better, and lead a life you absolutely love.

## **WORK EXPERIENCE & ACHIEVEMENTS**

I have guided over 550 people and transformed them into a healthy lifestyle under my mentorship. In the past, four of the group's volunteer teams have been trained by me. I am specialized in coaching people from all age groups and all gender through healthy diet plans & workout routines. I have successfully guided quite a number of homemakers and professionals who work in vital sectors of the country and abroad; including doctors, bankers, Ph.D. holders, and government officials. I have seen many diseases being recovered after weight loss. Major problems of infertility were reduced after losing weight. All these transformations and positive changes in hundreds of people’s lives are my motivation to keep going and helping thousands of people more.
