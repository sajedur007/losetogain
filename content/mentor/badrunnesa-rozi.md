## **Work Experience**

I'm with Lose To Gain as a volunteer & moderator since 2017. I have always found great satisfaction in helping, supporting, and caring for others. From the very beginning of the group, I have got the opportunity to conduct each and every yearly transformation competition successfully. From 2018 to now I have guided 120+ clients successfully. Among these clients, there are students, housewives, doctors, government & non-government employees of my country of origin and also helped internationally. My clients were of all different ages, ranging from 18 to 50+ years.

I believe sustainable quantified nutrition approach as per my client's goal, lifestyle, and keeping them motivated throughout the journey. Fitness is not a 12 or 24 weeks journey but I will ensure that these weeks empower you with science-based approaches, customized diet strategy, and weight loss programming so that you can continue and follow fitness as a lifestyle for great healthy feeling. Patients, a consistent and balance diet takes you a long long way! Leave your excuse and start your transformation journey with me. Hope to hear from you soon for a healthy and nutritious lifestyle.
